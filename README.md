Metakoans
=========

metakoans.rb is an arduous set of exercises designed to stretch
meta-programming muscle.  the focus is on a single method 'attribute' which
behaves much like the built-in 'attr', but whose properties require delving
deep into the depths of meta-ruby.  usage of the 'attribute' method follows
the general form of

```
class C
    attribute 'a'
end

o = C::new
o.a = 42  # setter - sets @a
o.a       # getter - gets @a 
o.a?      # query - true if @a
```

but reaches much farther than the standard 'attr' method as you will see
shortly.

your path, should you choose to follow it, is to write a single file
'**knowledge.rb**' implementing all functionality required by the koans below.
as a student of meta-programming your course will be guided by a guru whose
wisdom and pithy sayings will assist you on your journey.

a successful student will eventually be able to do this
